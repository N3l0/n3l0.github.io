            John Green is not only an author but also a vlogger, producer, and editor. For example, he is also known
            for the YouTube channel of him and his brother called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers" target="_blank">VlogBrothers</a>. <br />
            They got famous because John Green
            and his brother started to communicate only through the YouTube videos with each other.<br />
            But manly he is still an author. His books are available in more than 55 languages and over 24 million copies
            have been printed. He also won several awards for his books. Many say that his books bring in a new golden
            era for realistic teen fiction. An interesting fact is that John Green himself is a major critic of his own
            books which is quite unusual.
